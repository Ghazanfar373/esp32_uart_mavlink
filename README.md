# esp32_uart_mavlink
ESP32-ArduPilot Telemetry Bridge This project provides a robust solution for a companion computer (ESP32) to send custom telemetry data to an ArduPilot flight controller. It uses the MAVLink protocol to transmit real-time fuel and engine status, enabling enhanced monitoring and decision-making during flight missions.
